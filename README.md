🔍 Bitcoin Address Analyzer (analyze_addresses_hash160.py)

This Python tool scans a list of Bitcoin addresses, decodes them from Base58Check format, analyzes their HASH160 fingerprints, and identifies potentially suspicious or weak-looking addresses.

The goal is to detect addresses that might have been:

generated by faulty scripts,

created from simple or low-entropy private keys,

or used in brainwallet experiments.

⚙️ How It Works

Reads input file:
Expects a text file named btc_active_addressesbrain0.txt, where each line contains a Bitcoin address (optionally followed by | and extra info).

Decodes each address:

Performs Base58 decoding.

Verifies the checksum (Base58Check).

Extracts the version byte and the HASH160 (the 20-byte public key hash).

Applies heuristic analysis on each HASH160:

Checks for too few distinct bytes (low entropy).

Detects repeated byte patterns (like many 00 or ff).

Flags small byte value ranges (e.g., all bytes between 0x10–0x20).

Detects leading zero bytes (e.g., 000000...).

Calculates bit density (too few or too many bits set).

Marks addresses that trigger any heuristic as suspicious.

Writes results to suspicious_addresses.txt, with details:

address | hash160 | reasons | original_line


Displays summary at the end:

📂 File Structure
File	Description
analyze_addresses_hash160.py	Main script
btc_active_addressesbrain0.txt	Input list of Bitcoin addresses
suspicious_addresses.txt	Output file with detected anomalies
🧰 Requirements

Only standard Python libraries — no external dependencies.

✅ Works out-of-the-box with Python ≥ 3.6

▶️ Run Instructions

Make sure you have your input file in the same directory:

btc_active_addressesbrain0.txt


Run the script:

python3 analyze_addresses_hash160.py


When finished, check the results in:

suspicious_addresses.txt

⚠️ Heuristics Used
Heuristic	Description
low_distinct_bytes(n)	Very few unique bytes → low randomness
byte_xx_repeated_n	A single byte repeated too often
small_byte_range	All bytes fall in a very small numeric range
leading_zero_bytes=n	Address hash starts with several 0x00 bytes
low_bitcount(x)	Too few bits set (low entropy)
high_bitcount(x)	Too many bits set (unusual distribution)
invalid_base58check	Invalid checksum or Base58 format
🧠 Use Cases

Detecting artificial or brainwallet-like Bitcoin addresses.

Cleaning large address datasets before statistical analysis.

Studying address entropy distribution.

Researching possible address collisions or insecure generation methods.

🪪 Example Summary Output
Input file: btc_active_addressesbrain0.txt

💬 Notes

This tool does not connect to the blockchain or perform any network activity.
It only analyzes the address strings and their internal hash structure locally.
Safe to use offline, fully deterministic, and read-only.
